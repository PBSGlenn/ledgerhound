```

## Architecture Notes

### Double-Entry Accounting
- All transactions have 2+ postings that sum to zero
- Validation enforced in `transactionService.ts`
- Transfers auto-balance (bank-to-bank, no category needed)

**Why Categories Are Accounts:**
In double-entry accounting, everything is an account. The `Account` table stores both:
- **Real accounts** (`kind='TRANSFER'`): Banks, credit cards, Stripe (where money physically sits)
- **Category accounts** (`kind='CATEGORY'`): Income/expense classifications (how transactions are categorized)

See [STRIPE_ACCOUNTING_EXPLAINED.md](./STRIPE_ACCOUNTING_EXPLAINED.md) for detailed examples.

### Business vs Personal
- **Default**: All transactions are personal (no GST)
- **Business flag**: Set `isBusiness=true` on individual postings to enable GST tracking
- **Category defaults**:
  - Accounts can have `isBusinessDefault=true` to auto-enable business flag
  - Accounts can have `defaultHasGst=true/false` to control GST splitting (even when business)
  - Example: "Bank Fees" can be business but GST-free (set `defaultHasGst=false`)
- **GST validation**: Only enforced when `isBusiness=true` AND `defaultHasGst=true` (or not set)

### GST (Australian Tax)
- 10% standard rate
- **GST Collected** (LIABILITY, category): GST you owe to ATO
- **GST Paid** (ASSET, category): GST you can claim back from ATO
- Net GST position = GST Collected - GST Paid
- BAS payments are transfers from bank to ATO (not to/from GST accounts)

### Database
- SQLite via Prisma ORM
- Migrations in `prisma/migrations/`
- Seed data in `prisma/seed.ts` (run with `npm run db:seed`)

### Services Layer
All business logic is in TypeScript services (not Rust):
- **accountService**: CRUD, balances, archiving, hierarchies
- **categoryService**: Hierarchical category management with unlimited nesting, tree operations, path traversal
- **transactionService**: Create/update/delete, double-entry validation, GST validation, register views, bulk operations
- **stripeImportService**: Stripe Balance Transaction API integration, auto-creates GST categories, 5-way split accounting, fee GST extraction
- **importService**: CSV parsing with column mapping, templates, deduplication, memorized rule application
- **reconciliationService**: Session management, posting reconciliation, balance calculations, lock/unlock
- **reportService**: P&L, GST Summary, BAS Draft (all complete with category grouping)
- **memorizedRuleService**: Pattern matching (exact, contains, regex), priority-based, preview and apply
- **settingsService**: JSON-based settings storage in database
- **backupService**: Automatic database backups on startup, manual backups, restore, cleanup, JSON export
- **pdfStatementService**: PDF parsing and statement extraction
- **reconciliationMatchingService**: Statement parsing and transaction matching algorithms
- **bookManager**: Multi-book support (stub/planned)

## Testing
- **Unit tests**: Vitest (service layer)
- **E2E tests**: Playwright (UI flows)
- **Coverage**: Double-entry validation, GST calculations, import deduplication, reconciliation

### Key test scenarios
1. Personal transaction (no GST)
2. Business transaction (with GST)
3. Mixed split (personal + business)
4. Transfer (no category, auto-balances)
5. CSV import with deduplication
6. Reconciliation flow

### 🔨 In Progress
- Fixing Stripe GST extraction bug (code ready, requires API restart and transaction re-import)

### 📋 TODO
- Reconciliation UI polish (backend complete, needs PDF viewer integration and tick-off UI)
- Comprehensive tests (unit + E2E)
- User documentation
- Multi-book support (bookManager stub exists)
- Tauri desktop packaging (currently web-based)

### 🎉 Recent Additions (October 2025)
- **Category Hierarchy System**:
  - Unlimited nesting with parent/child relationships
  - Virtual parent nodes for better organization
  - 9 new API endpoints for tree operations
  - Context menu with rich actions (settings, rename, add subcategory, archive, delete)
  - Category form modal for quick creation with parent context
- **Account Settings Modal**:
  - Edit account properties (business flag, default GST, opening balance)
  - Visual indicators for account type and configuration
  - Read-only account information display
- **Enhanced GST Control**:
  - New `defaultHasGst` field in database (migration: 20251030010306)
  - Ability to mark business categories as GST-free (e.g., bank fees)
  - Explicit GST postings system (GST Paid/Collected as separate lines)
  - Migration script to convert old GST format to new format
- **Category Service**:
  - Complete hierarchical category management
  - Tree structure operations (path, children, ancestors, siblings)
  - Context-aware operations
  - Inheritable settings from parent categories
- **Improved Transaction Form**:
  - Memorized rule suggestions on payee change

### 🐛 Known Issues
- **Stripe Fee GST Extraction Bug**:
  - **Symptom**: `feeGst: 0` instead of calculated amount (e.g., 0.37 for a $4.07 fee)
  - **Root Cause**: Fee details extraction logic in stripeImportService
  - **Fix Status**: Code is corrected in stripeImportService.ts
  - **Action Required**: Restart API server and re-import affected transactions
  - **Impact**: 51 transactions show incorrect fee GST amounts
  - **Workaround**: Delete affected transactions and re-import from Stripe

6. Implement multi-book support (stub exists in bookManager)

### Technology Highlights
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout with strict mode
- **ORM**: Prisma with type-safe queries and migrations
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI for accessible, polished components
