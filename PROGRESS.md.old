## üî® In Progress

### UI Components
Current focus is building the user interface:
- Register grid (transaction table with two-line display)
- Transaction form modal (add/edit with business/GST controls)
- CSV import wizard
- Reconciliation interface
- Reports dashboards

---

## üìã TODO

### High Priority
1. **Register Grid Component**
   - Two-line transaction display (Date|Payee|Debit|Credit|Balance on line 1)
   - Category|Memo|Tags|Business badge|GST code on line 2
   - Inline editing with keyboard navigation
   - Running balance calculations
   - Filters (date, amount, business/personal, cleared, reconciled)
   - Selection and bulk actions

2. **Transaction Form Modal**
   - Simple mode (one category) and split mode (multiple categories)
   - Business toggle per split (conditional GST fields)
   - Transfer mode (auto-balance between accounts)
   - Memorized rule preview and application
   - Validation (sum to zero, GST when business)

3. **CSV Import Wizard**
   - File upload
   - Column mapping UI
   - Preview with deduplication warnings
   - Rule matching display
   - Bulk category assignment
   - Import confirmation

### Medium Priority
4. **Reconciliation UI**
   - Statement-based reconciliation workflow
   - Side-by-side PDF viewer (PDF.js integration)
   - Manual tick-off interface
   - Balance difference indicator
   - Lock/unlock sessions

5. **Reports UI**
   - P&L report with filters
   - GST Summary (business only)
   - BAS Draft (with export to PDF/CSV)
   - Tag reports
   - Date range selector

### Lower Priority
6. **Settings UI**
   - Organization details (name, ABN, address)
   - GST configuration (enable/disable, default rate)
   - Locale settings (date format, timezone, currency)
   - Backup configuration
   - Account defaults (mark as business default)

7. **Backup & Export**
   - Auto-backup on close (.db + .json)
   - Manual backup trigger
   - Export registers to CSV
   - Export reports to PDF/CSV

8. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all services
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Test double-entry validation
   - Test GST calculations
   - Test import deduplication
   - Test reconciliation flows

9. **Documentation**
   - User guide
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - GST/BAS guide for Australian users
   - Build and deployment instructions

## üéØ Key Design Principles

### Business vs Personal Separation
- **Default behavior**: All transactions are personal (no GST tracking)
- **Opt-in business**: Set `isBusiness=true` on individual postings to enable GST
- **Category defaults**: Mark accounts as "business default" to auto-enable GST
- **UI behavior**: GST fields only visible when `isBusiness=true` or category has `isBusinessDefault=true`

### Double-Entry Accounting
- All transactions have 2+ postings that sum to zero
- Validation enforced at service layer
- Transfers auto-balance (no category needed)
- Cannot delete accounts with transactions (archive instead)

### GST (Australian Tax)
- Only tracked on business-flagged postings
- 10% standard rate
- Codes: GST, GST_FREE, INPUT_TAXED, EXPORT, OTHER
- Stored on each posting (not as separate account entries)
- Reports filter to business transactions only
- BAS rounded to whole dollars

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (React + TypeScript)
    ‚Üì
Services Layer (TypeScript)
    ‚Üì
Prisma ORM
    ‚Üì
SQLite Database
```

**Why TypeScript for business logic?**
- Easier to test and maintain
- Direct Prisma integration
- Faster development than Rust
- Tauri is just the desktop wrapper

---

## üìä Current Metrics

- **Database Tables**: 8 (Account, Transaction, Posting, MemorizedRule, ImportBatch, Reconciliation, Settings, plus Prisma metadata)
- **Services**: 6 complete services with ~2000 lines of business logic
- **Type Definitions**: ~200 lines of comprehensive TypeScript types
- **Seed Data**: 13 accounts, 5 transactions, 2 rules, 4 settings
- **UI Components**: 3 layout components (MainLayout, AccountSidebar, TopBar)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Build the register grid component (core UI for viewing transactions)
2. Create the transaction form modal (add/edit transactions)
3. Test the complete flow: Create account ‚Üí Add transaction ‚Üí View in register
4. Add CSV import wizard
5. Add reconciliation UI
6. Add reports dashboard
7. Comprehensive testing
8. User documentation

## üìù Notes for Future Development

### Prisma Client Location
- Prisma client is generated to `node_modules/@prisma/client`
- Can be imported with `import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'`

### Database Location
- Development database: `prisma/dev.db`
- Migrations: `prisma/migrations/`
- Seed script: `prisma/seed.ts` (run with `npm run db:seed`)

### Running the App
```bash
# Development mode (desktop app)
npm run tauri:dev

# Frontend only (for UI development)
npm run dev

# Database management
npm run db:studio      # Prisma Studio (GUI)
npm run db:seed        # Reseed database
npm run db:migrate     # Create/apply migrations
```

### Debugging
- Use Prisma Studio to inspect database: `npm run db:studio`
- Check console logs for service errors
- Verify double-entry sum (should be 0 ¬± 0.01)
- Check GST calculations (amount * rate / (1 + rate))
