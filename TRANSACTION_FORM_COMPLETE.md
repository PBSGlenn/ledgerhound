## 🧪 How to Test It

### Step 1: Refresh Your Browser
The dev server should have auto-reloaded. If not, refresh `http://localhost:1420`

### Step 2: Select an Account
Click on any account in the sidebar (e.g., "Personal Checking")

### Step 3: Click "New Transaction"
The button should now be enabled!

### Step 4: Fill Out the Form
1. **Date**: Today's date is pre-filled
2. **Payee**: Type "Woolworths"
3. **Amount**: Type "110"
4. **Category**: Select "Groceries"
5. **Business**: Leave unchecked (personal transaction)
6. **Memo**: Type "Weekly shopping"

### Step 5: Click "Save Transaction"

**What happens:**
- Form will try to save (currently using mock API)
- You'll see "Saving..." button
- Form will close
- Console will log the transaction data

## 📝 Test with Business Transaction

Try adding a business expense with GST:

1. Select "Business Checking" account
2. Click "New Transaction"
3. Fill in:
   - **Payee**: "Officeworks"
   - **Amount**: "110"
   - **Category**: "Office Supplies"
   - **Business**: ✅ **Check this box**
   - **Memo**: "Printer paper"

**Watch the GST calculator appear!**
- Total (GST inc.): $110.00
- GST amount: $10.00
- GST-exclusive: $100.00

Click "Save Transaction"

## ⚠️ Current Limitation

**The transaction won't actually save yet** because we're using mock API data.

**Why:**
- `src/lib/api.ts` currently has `createTransaction` that throws "Not implemented"
- We need to implement Tauri commands to connect to the real database

**But the UI works perfectly!** You can:
- ✅ Open the form
- ✅ Fill it out
- ✅ See GST calculations
- ✅ See validation
- ✅ See the form UI

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Afternoon Session)

Now that the UI is working, let's connect it to the real database!

### Option 1: Implement Tauri Commands (3-4 hours)

This will make everything actually work!

**What you'll do:**
1. Install `@tauri-apps/plugin-sql`
2. Configure Tauri to use SQLite
3. Update `src/lib/api.ts` to call real Tauri commands
4. Test end-to-end!

**Result:** Transaction form saves to real database, register shows real transactions! 🎉

### Option 2: Quick Mock Data Fix (15 minutes)

Just to see the register grid populated:

Update `src/lib/api.ts` to return some mock transactions instead of empty array.

## 💡 Tips

### Testing Different Scenarios

**Personal grocery:**
- Account: Personal Checking
- Category: Groceries
- Business: ❌ Unchecked
- Amount: $50

**Business meal:**
- Account: Business Checking
- Category: Business Meals
- Business: ✅ Checked
- Amount: $75 (shows GST: $6.82)

**Income:**
- Account: Business Checking
- Category: Sales Income (in Income group)
- Business: ✅ Checked
- Amount: $1000

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Button is disabled:**
- Make sure you've selected an account first!

**Form doesn't open:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure dev server is running

**GST not calculating:**
- Make sure "Business" checkbox is checked
- Make sure amount is > 0

**Categories not loading:**
- Currently using mock data which has the categories
- Will load from real DB once Tauri commands are implemented

## 📚 Code Files Modified

1. **Created:**
   - `src/components/Transaction/TransactionFormModal.tsx` (new component)

2. **Modified:**

**You now have a working transaction form!**

This is the **core interaction** of a ledger app - adding transactions. The UI is beautiful, functional, and ready to be connected to the real backend.

**Great progress!** 🚀
