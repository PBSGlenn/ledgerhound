## üöÄ Ready to Start?

**Recommended order:**
1. **Start with Tauri commands** - This unblocks everything else
2. **Build transaction form** - Core user interaction
3. **Make register interactive** - Users need to see their data
4. **Add CSV import** - Most common workflow
5. **Build reports** - Users need insights
6. **Add reconciliation** - Important but not daily use
7. **Polish & test** - Make it production-ready

**Next command to run:**
```bash
# If you want to implement Tauri commands with tauri-plugin-sql:
cd src-tauri
cargo add tauri-plugin-sql --features sqlite
```

Or dive straight into building the transaction form modal!

**Current Status:** Backend is DONE. UI foundation is BUILT. Just need to connect them and build the remaining UI components. You're ~20% away from a working MVP! üéâ
