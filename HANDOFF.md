**Status:** ‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL - Express Backend Connected!
**Completion:** 90% to MVP

---

## ‚úÖ What's Ready to Use

### 1. Run the App Right Now

```bash
# Kill any background processes first
npx kill-port 1420 3001

# Start BOTH API server and frontend
npm run dev:all

# Opens at http://localhost:1420
# API running at http://localhost:3001
```

**What you'll see:**
- ‚úÖ Beautiful UI with sidebar showing **REAL accounts from database**
- ‚úÖ Accounts grouped by type (Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses)
- ‚úÖ **REAL balances** calculated from actual transactions
- ‚úÖ "Biz" badge on business accounts
- ‚úÖ Top bar with action buttons
- ‚úÖ Register grid showing **REAL transactions from database**
- ‚úÖ **Transaction form** - Click "New Transaction" to add entries!
- ‚úÖ **CSV Import Wizard** - Click "Import CSV" to upload, map, preview, and import transactions!

### 2. Explore the Database

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio
npm run db:studio

# Opens at http://localhost:5555
```

**What to explore:**
- Click **Account** - See all 13 accounts (personal + business)

## üìã What Remains (To MVP)

### Critical Path (8-12 hours)

**1. Make Register Interactive** (1-2 hours)
- Click transaction to edit (uses existing form)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter, E, D, C, R)
- Context menu
- Loading states
- Error handling

**2. Split Transactions UI** (2-3 hours)
- Add "Split" mode to transaction form
- Multiple category lines with individual amounts
- Business toggle per split
- Per-split GST calculations
- Validation (all splits must sum to total)

**3. Reconciliation UI with PDF viewer** (4-5 hours)

**4. Reports Dashboard** (3-4 hours)

### Important (Post-MVP)

5. Settings UI (2 hours)
6. Testing (4-6 hours)
7. Documentation (2-3 hours)

**Total to MVP: 8-12 hours** ‚ú®
**Total to Complete: ~25 hours**

## üöÄ How to Continue

### Next Steps (Choose Your Priority)

**Option 1: Make Register Interactive** (1-2 hours)
- Click transaction row ‚Üí Opens edit form
- Add keyboard shortcuts (E=edit, D=delete, C=clear)
- Add loading states and error handling
- Polish UX with animations

**Option 2: Add Split Transaction Support** (2-3 hours)
- Extend transaction form with "Split" mode
- Allow multiple category lines
- Per-split business toggle and GST
- Validation that splits sum to total

**Option 3: Build Reports Dashboard** (3-4 hours)
- Create Reports view
- P&L report (already implemented in backend)
- GST Summary (already implemented)
- BAS Draft (already implemented)
- Just needs UI to display the data!

**Option 4: Reconciliation UI** (4-5 hours)
- Start reconciliation dialog
- Show list of unreconciled transactions
- Finish button (when difference = 0)

**Recommended Order:**
1. Make register interactive (improves daily use)
2. Add split transactions (common use case)
3. Build reports (essential for tax time)
4. Add reconciliation UI (advanced feature)

## üß™ Testing What's Built

### Test Backend Services (via Prisma Studio)

1. Open Prisma Studio: `npm run db:studio`
2. Create a transaction manually:
   - Go to Transaction table ‚Üí Add record
   - Fill in date, payee, memo
   - Save
3. Add postings (the double-entry part):
   - Go to Posting table ‚Üí Add record
   - posting 1: accountId (bank), amount: -100, isBusiness: false
   - posting 2: accountId (expense), amount: 100, isBusiness: false
   - Sum must equal 0!
4. Refresh Transaction table ‚Üí See your transaction
5. Check Account balances ‚Üí Should reflect the transaction

### Test Business Transaction with GST

Create postings with:
- posting 1: accountId (business bank), amount: -110
- posting 2: accountId (office supplies), amount: 100, isBusiness: true, gstCode: GST, gstRate: 0.1, gstAmount: 10

### Test Reports (via Node.js)

```javascript
// Create a test script: test-reports.js
import { reportService } from './src/lib/services/index.js';

const basDraft = await reportService.generateBASDraft(
  new Date('2025-07-01'),
  new Date('2025-09-30')
);

console.log('G1 Total Sales:', basDraft.g1TotalSales);
console.log('1A GST on Sales:', basDraft.oneAGSTOnSales);
console.log('Net GST:', basDraft.netGST);
```

Run: `node test-reports.js`

## üî• Common Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev:all            # ‚ú® Start BOTH API + UI (RECOMMENDED)
npm run dev                # UI only (http://localhost:1420)
npm run api                # API only (http://localhost:3001)

# Database
npm run db:studio          # Prisma Studio GUI (http://localhost:5555)
npm run db:seed            # Reset with sample data
npm run db:migrate         # Run migrations

# Utilities
npx kill-port 1420 3001    # Kill both dev servers if ports stuck

# Build
npm run build              # Build frontend

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Port 1420 or 3001 already in use**
   - Solution: `npx kill-port 1420 3001`

2. **Split transactions not supported yet**
   - Current: Simple transactions only (one category)
   - Coming: Multi-split with per-split GST (2-3 hours work)

3. **Register Grid Interactivity**
   - Need to implement click handlers for editing, keyboard navigation, and bulk actions.

4. **No Error Handling UI**
   - Errors are logged to console. Need toast notifications or error modals.

5. **No Loading States**
   - Some components show basic loading text. Need skeleton loaders or spinners.

6. **Dark Mode Toggle Missing**
   - Dark mode CSS is ready. Need UI toggle in settings or top bar.

## üí° Tips for Development

### Debugging Backend Services

```javascript
// Test services directly in Node.js
import { accountService } from './src/lib/services/index.js';

const accounts = await accountService.getAllAccountsWithBalances();
console.log(accounts);
```

### Understanding the Data Model

**Key concept: Double-Entry**
- Every transaction has 2+ postings
- Postings must sum to zero
- Example: Buy $100 supplies
  - Bank: -$100 (credit)
  - Supplies: +$100 (debit)
  - Sum: 0 ‚úÖ

**Business vs Personal:**
- Default: `isBusiness = false` (no GST)
- Set `isBusiness = true` to track GST
- Categories can have `isBusinessDefault = true`

### Working with GST

**GST-Inclusive amounts:**
- Total: $110
- GST (10%): $10
- GST-exclusive: $100

**Calculation:**
```javascript
const total = 110;
const gst = total * 0.1 / 1.1;  // = 10
const exclusive = total - gst;   // = 100
```
